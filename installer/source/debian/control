Description: Calculator application for champs that are okay.
 This calculator was built by blood and sweat amidst
 great coronavirus crisis of 2020. As of writing this text we are not
 sure if this project will see the light of day. But anyway, this calc
 is dedicated to all the OkayChamps out there FeelsOkayMan.
